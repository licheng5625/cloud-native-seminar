# What is K8s
Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime. For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start.
Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.
