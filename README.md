# What is REST(Representational State Transfer)

- provides a HTTP interface for a resource e.g. product
- supports HTTP verbs: POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- provides atomic operations ("all or nothing")
# Guiding Constraints
A system is only RESTful, if it does not violate any of the six guiding constraints.
The most important are:

*Cacheability*: Responses must define themselves as either cacheable or non-cacheable
*Statelessness*: communication is stateless
    - resource state is stored on the server and is sharable to all clients
    - application state is stored on each client and consists of information that cannot be shared.
    - clients are responsible for passing application state to the server when it needs it.
